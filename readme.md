## About Laravel

A few months back, I have a friend-worked as a remote english teacher-who laments that he have to collate a collosal amount of emails (564 in total, I might be wrong...). Those emails contain information about the students that has worked with over the years. It contained the student's email address as well, which is the data that he's after. He wanted to send his former students an email that would urge them to resume their lessons with him for half the price of the english teaching agency that he used to work in. I realized that his predicament can be solved using laravel, so I took it upon myself to develop an app that rummage thru my friend's gmail account, compiled all of his student's email, seed it to my database, and call it whenever he wants to send a massive email spree to his students. Which look a little something like this <br><br>

<br><br>

I used Redis and socket IO to implement a loading bar that shows how many emails have been sent. <br><br>
